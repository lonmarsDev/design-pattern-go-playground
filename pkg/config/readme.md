## How to use

### Configurations based on Environment variables

Follow this example to know how to use this package

```go

    // Get Config value from Environment Variables
    // key: is the name of the variable
    // Default Value will be the Value if the variable not found
    config.GetEnvironment().Get("Key", "Default Value")

    // Set Config value from Environment Variables
    // Key: the name of the variables
    // value: the value of the variable
    config.GetEnvironment().Set("Key", "Value")

```

### Configuration based on file

you have to create environment variables to use this type of config:

- `CONFIG_FILE_PATH` the path of the file which will contains this configuration, this file will be in plain text so take care of this

```go
    // Get Config value from File
    // key: is the name of the variable
    // Default Value will be the Value if the variable not found
    config.GetFile().Get("Key", "Default Value")

    // Set Config value from File
    // Key: the name of the variables
    // value: the value of the variable
    config.GetFile().Set("Key", "Value")
```

## Developer Guide

You can add another config which could be used in the same service

For example if you want to add a config file that use the Database then you will implement
`GetDB()` inside the `config` package and this function should return a new **struct**
that implements the `Config` **interface**

you will follow something such as the **env** package.
